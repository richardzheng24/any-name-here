I picked the question "Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?" since I recently had this experience occur to me in a flight during December. I was curious as to bring up to people in the front seat of me were rude for inclining far back and I was curious to see what the consensus was. My chart shows surprisingly that it's NOT rude and that majority people believe it isn't rude at all. I believe that part of the reason people say it isn't rude is because the degree in which the recline on the seat matters for whether it's rude or not. In my personal experience it felt very rude, but it's interesting to see how people respond more positively to it.
